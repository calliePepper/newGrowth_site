                        <span>Welcome!</span><br />
                        My name is Simon Freeman and I am a Game Designer currently situated in Brisbane, Australia. I have been involved in a variety of game projects over the last few years, ranging from shooters through to horror through to online social games. <br />
						I have a lifelong love of game, sound and level design, as well as exceptional skills with music composition, and even script and story writing. These skills lead me to study and acquire a Bachelor of Interavtive Entertainment (majoring in Games Design) and a Diploma of Music. <br />
						I've always enjoyed the notion of the virtual world that comes with video games, especially well designed games that immerse the player for hours at a time. I enjoy making games, and seek to make the most of my experiences in gaming. <br />
						I am very much a retro console gamer. I especially love older games and am greatly inspired by them and their designers, such as Shigeru Miyamoto, Gunpei Yokoi and Tokuro Fujiwara.  That doesn't stop me enjoying modern games though, especially the works of Dice, Bethesda and Ubisoft.<br/>
